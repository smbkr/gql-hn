# A GraphQL powered link aggregator

This is a GraphQL powered API for a link aggregator (think Hacker News, Reddit), which supports:

- Posting, updating and deleting links
- "Upvoting" links
- User registration and auth

## Todo

- Extract update & delete mutations
- Require auth for update & delete
- Add upvote count to Link items
- Add client (WIP)
- Use a Docker container for the DB for local development
- Add tests
